# DOTS-Swarm-Simulation
A high-performance swarm simulation built with Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), Entity Component System (ECS), Burst Compiler, and Job System. This project demonstrates advanced Unity optimization techniques capable of simulating 10,000+ entities at 60 FPS.

Key Features:

🐟 10,000+ agents with realistic flocking behavior

🦈 Predator-prey dynamics with intelligent AI

⚡ High-performance using DOTS/ECS

🎯 Spatial partitioning for efficient neighbor detection

🚀 Instanced rendering for optimal GPU usage

⚙️ Real-time parameter tuning

🛠️ Technologies Used
Unity 2022.3+ - Game engine
